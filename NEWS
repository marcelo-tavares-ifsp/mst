* Changes in version 1.0.0 (2021-02-24)
** Release of the first stable version of MST
** New USB auto-mount implementation
   It is implemented in a separate "mstd" daemon that mounts connected USB
   storage devices using the standard udev subsystem.
** Allow to use MST in heterogeneous setups
   MST now allows to configure a multi-seat setup on systems with displays that
   using different resolutions.
** Add screen warnings on USB input device disconnections
   When a USB input device attached to seat disconnects, the "mstd" shows a
   warning.  This helps to track down bad USB contacts.
** Implement new configuration UI
** Now MST depends on Guile-UDEV and GNU Guile
   Currently Guile-UDEV is used as a project sub-module and built along with the
   MST source code.
