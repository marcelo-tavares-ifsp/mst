* Unreleased
** General changes
*** Remove the dependency on "unclutter"
    "mstd" now hides the mouse cursor.
*** mst: The configurator now creates the multiseat system user
    The multiseat user specified in the configuration file is created when MST
    installs the prepared configuration to the system.
*** mstd: Now it allows to choose the display server backend
    There's now "--display-server-backend" option for that.

    Supported backends are: "xephyr" and "xephyr-docker" (default)

    "xephyr-docker" allows to start a Xephyr instance inside a Docker
    container (build from "gkaz/xephyr" Docker image.)  The advantage is that
    not all systems have Xephyr built with "evdev" support required for MST to
    work properly; the Xephyr version inside the Docker image has "evdev"
    support.

    When "xephyr" backend is used then Xephyr starts from the host system
    directly.
*** mstd: Now the executable generated from the source 
    Now the executable is generated from the source with the actual "guile"
    full binary path.
*** mstd: Set the seat display resolution with xrandr
    mstd now sets the display resolution for each seat; this allows for better
    support of configurations that use monitors with different aspect ratio.
*** guix: Add GNU Guix build script.
** Bugfixes
*** LightDM: Presence check is now more reliable
*** ALT Linux P10: Generate missing PAM configuration
*** mst: Now performs "chown" on the multiseat home properly
    The configurator has a bug that lead to chown'ing the multiseat home
    directory to the "root" user.  Now it is fixed.
*** mst: Now creates ".Xauthority" file for the multiseat user
*** mst, awesome: Fix the user ".config" installation
    "mst" would try to install the ".config" directory to
    "/home/<mst-user>.config" instead of "/home/<mst-user>/.config" (note the
    missing "/".)  Now it is fixed.
** Building/installation
*** Check the presence of required programs on the host
    MST now checks if all the required programs are present on the host during
    the build.  Actual paths to the programs are substituted in the sources.
** Testing/CI
*** GitLab CI now run tests on ALT P8, P10 and Ubuntu 20.04

* Changes in version 2.0.0 (2022-02-16)
** General changes

    https://github.com/artyom-poptsov/guile-udev
*** Require Docker
*** MST now officially supports Ubuntu GNU/Linux 20.04
*** MST now officially supports ALT GNU/Linux 9
*** Display manager and Xephyr instances now start from 'mstd'
*** Xephyr instances now start in Docker containers
*** Seat resolutions now stored in the configuration
*** LightDM now does not hide the user list
*** Improve internationalization
*** Remove backup scripts
    - scripts/mk_backup.sh
    - scripts/apl_backup.sh
** Bugfixes
*** Fix backups; perform backups in 'mst'
*** Don't install test cases
** mst
*** New option: '--list-backups'
    The option shows the list of backups.
*** New option: '--status'
    The option shows the status of 'mstd' daemon.
*** New option: '--start'
*** New option: '--stop'
    The option stops running 'mstd' daemon.
*** Improve logging
** mstd
*** Improve logging   
*** 'mstd' now has '--stderr' option
*** Implement unit tests
** Building/installation
*** Make compilation less verbose
*** 'install.sh': New building/installation script

* Changes in version 1.0.0 (2021-02-24)
** Release of the first stable version of MST
** New USB auto-mount implementation
   It is implemented in a separate "mstd" daemon that mounts connected USB
   storage devices using the standard udev subsystem.
** Allow to use MST in heterogeneous setups
   MST now allows to configure a multi-seat setup on systems with displays that
   using different resolutions.
** Add screen warnings on USB input device disconnections
   When a USB input device attached to seat disconnects, the "mstd" shows a
   warning.  This helps to track down bad USB contacts.
** Implement new configuration UI
** Now MST depends on Guile-UDEV and GNU Guile
   Currently Guile-UDEV is used as a project sub-module and built along with the
   MST source code.

 
* Changes in version 0.1.0 (2018-08-29)
